* Codebase exploration

While I'm searching inside the code base, when I'm finding something
interesting, I put a comment appended with =SC:=. To find them all:

#+begin_src bash :results output :wrap "src conf :eval never"
grep -R " SC:" ./apps ./repos
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src conf :eval never
./repos/apache-mynewt-nimble/nimble/host/include/host/ble_store.h: * SC: Structure contained key material stored during pairing.
./repos/apache-mynewt-nimble/nimble/host/include/host/ble_store.h:    /** SC: Note about the endianness of LTK storage.
./repos/apache-mynewt-nimble/nimble/host/src/ble_store.c:/** SC: Write the key material in the security database during pairing. */
./repos/apache-mynewt-nimble/nimble/controller/include/controller/ble_ll_conn.h:/* SC: ble_ll_conn_sm definition, the state machine of the current connection
#+end_src
